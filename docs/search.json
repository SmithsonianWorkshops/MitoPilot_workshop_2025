    "text": "Problematic Samples\nIn this test dataset, there are two problematic samples which returned failed states. You can see which samples failed by looking for the exclamation mark state icon. Selecting a sample with that icon and clicking on the STATE button will confirm.\n\n\n\nFig. 24\n\n\nOne failed sample is SRR22396758 (Upeneus parvus). We purposefully truncated the data for this sample to contain only 200 reads.\nWith so few reads, this sample failed to meet the min_depth threshold and returned a message “Insufficient sequencing depth” in the Notes column. When analyzing your own data, you can specify the min_depth threshold with the new_project function.\nThe other failed sample is SRR21844202 (Fundulus majalis). This sample had plenty of data and we were able to assemble a mitogenome. However, the message in the Notes columns says “Unable to resolve single assembly from reads.”\nGetOrganelle produced two alternate assembly paths for this sample. This is usually due to complicated assembly graphs near a repeat region. Please refer to the GetOrganlle paper for more information about multiple assembly paths.\nLet’s take a peek at SRR21844202 (Fundulus majalis). Select the sample, scroll all the way to the right, and click on details.\n\n\n\nFig. 25\n\n\nWe can see two assemblies listed here. Clicking on view will show us the coverage, error, and GC content graphs for each assembly.\nPath #1\n\n\n\nFig. 26\n\n\nPath #2\n\n\n\nFig. 27\n\n\nThe two assembly paths differ slightly around 13,000 bp.\nWe can chose to move forward with just one assembly path by clicking the “ignore” button for one of the assembly paths.\nAlternatively, we can use the consensus sequence. Select both paths and click the Align button in the bottom right. The sequence alignment will pop up, showing us that the two paths have 99.9897% sequence similarity.\nIf we scroll through the alignment, we can see a few base pair differences.\n\n\n\nFig. 28\n\n\nSelecting Trim Consensus will remove any conflicting regions of the aligned assembly paths and produce a shorter consensus sequence of both alignments. Doing so will automatically ignore the original two assembly paths.\n\n\n\nFig. 29\n\n\nClick close and return to the samples table. You will see that the # Paths column for SRR21844202 is highlighted and there is a note indicating that the assembly was edited. This sample has also been automatically changed to a locked state.\n\n\n\nFig. 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nCarefully consider your options for samples with multiple assembly paths. You may wish to align each assembly against a reference or compare depth of sequencing coverage. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n\nTo proceed to the Annotate module, we need to lock the successful samples in the Assemble module. Select all of the samples except SRR22396758 (Upeneus parvus) and click the LOCK button. Then use the dropdown menu in the top left to navigate to the Annotate module.\n\n\n\nFig. 31",

    "text": "Exploring Annotation Results\nThere are a LOT of results to explore from the Annotate module. The sample table reports some basic stats about the number of protein-coding genes (PCGs), tRNAs, and rRNAs. The missing column reports which mitochondrial genes were not annotated (based on the provided curation model). The extra column notes the number of potentially duplicated genes.\nLastly, the warnings column indicates how many warning flags were raised during the validation step. Samples with many warnings will require more manual curation to ensure that they are not rejected upon submission to NCBI GenBank. Warning messages are explained in further detail here.\n\n\n\nFig. 35\n\n\nThe annotation results for each sample can be examined more closely by clicking the details button. First, let’s examine the details for a good sample, SRR19434536 (Rhinecanthus rectangulus).\n\n\n\nFig. 36\n\n\nThis sample has the expected number of genes and has no warnings. However, the notes column shows that MitoPilot still made some tweaks to the annotation during the curation step. For example, the start position of rRNA rrnL was moved 22 bp upstream and the stop codon for NAD2 was trimmed by 2 bp.\nNucleotide sequences (and amino acid sequence for PCGs) can be copied to the clipboard using the nt (and aa) buttons on the far right. This could be helpful if you’d like to manually BLAST some genes.\nClicking on the Coverage Map button will show a plot of sequence depth, zooming to the position of the highlighted gene. The colored bars representing the genes are transparent, allowing you to spot overlapping gene models which may be incorrect.\n\n\n\nFig. 37\n\n\nFor protein coding genes, you can click the Alignment button to show the protein alignment of your annotated gene against a reference database. Currently, this shows only the top hits (filtered in blast using -best_hit_score_edge 0.01) from the curation process, which may be one or more sequences.\n\n\n\nFig. 38\n\n\nIf you would like to use your own custom BLAST database, you can check the Local blast box. MitoPilot will return a message with the instructions: run options('MitoPilot.local.db' = '/path/to/local/blastp/db') within your RStudio session.

    "text": "Editing Annotation Results\nMitoPilot offers some basic functions to manually edit your annotation results. Let’s open the alignment for the SRR19434536 (Rhinecanthus rectangulus) “cox1” gene. Clicking the EDIT button brings up a few options to change the start and stop position annotation.\nTry clicking the + button next to START. You should see that the “cox1 (focal)” sequence start position has shifted.\n\n\n\nFig. 39\n\n\nThis is clearly a worse alignment. Click RESET to undo your changes.\nIf the alignment view contains many sequences, manual editing will be slow since MitoPilot has to redo the alignments every time you click a + or - button. To help speed this up, you can select the Align fewer refs box. This will restrict the alignment to the top five BLAST hits.\nBelow the alignment section you will find the Notes. Use this section to keep track of your manual edits. Anything you write here will be saved automatically.\n\n\n\nFig. 40\n\n\nAt the bottom of the window are several buttons. You can completely remove annotations by selecting them and clicking Delete. Use this feature with caution, as there’s no easy way to add the annotation back without running the sample through the Annotate module again.\nThe Linearize button will convert a circular assembly to a linear assembly. This may be useful if the D-loop region was poorly assmebled or annotated.\nYou can use the Toggle reviewed button to change the state of the Reviewed column, which may be helpful for tracking the progress of your manual edits. Likewise, we have provided Toggle ID verified and Toggle problematic buttons to help track the status of your samples.\nAnnotation editing can be a bit temperamental and you may encounter bugs. Please report any problems on the MitoPilot GitHub issues page.\nTry playing around with the manual editing on your own. There are many different types of warning messages, not all of which can be fixed within MitoPilot.\nOnce you are done, select all of the samples and click the LOCK button to prepare for the Export module.",

The first icon shows whether the sample is locked or unlocked. If a sample is unlocked, it will be included when running the current pipeline module. A locked sample cannot be edited for the current module, but will be made available for the next pipeline module. You can toggle the lock by selecting the sample (check mark), then pressing LOCK at the top of the window. Multiple samples can be locked or unlocked simultaneously.\n\n\n\nFig. 5\n\n\nThe other icon shows the state of the sample. These states vary depending on the analysis module and will be automatically updated when running the pipeline. However, you can also manually change the state of a sample using the STATE button.

We can modify these by clicking the edit checkbox. Let’s change the memory to 20 GB. You could also change the options passed to fastp, but we’ll keep those at the defaults for now.\n\n\n\nFig. 8\n\n\nWe can save these new parameter options by clicking on the Parameter set name box, typing a new name, and clicking Add YOUR NEW NAME... in the dropdown. Finally, click Update in the bottom right to save your selection.\n\n\n\nFig. 9\n\n\nOnce you’ve saved a new parameter set, you can easily access it again using the dropdown menu.

But for this test dataset, let’s keep everything consistent.\nLet’s also change the Assembly Opts. Repeat the process above, and creating a new high_mem setting with 6 CPUs and 60 GB of memory.\n\n\n\nFig. 12\n\n\nThe Assembly Opts window has more options to tinker with. With the Assembler dropdown menu, you can choose between GetOrganalle and MitoFinder.\nGetOrganelle is the default assembler for MitoPilot, as it is considerably faster. The downside is that it requires good reference mitogenomes. Thankfully, there are many high-quality fish mitogenomes available. MitoFinder may be a better choice for clades with few reference sequences.\nYou can modify the parameters for GetOrganalle, including the seeds and labels databases. The default fish reference databases are downloaded from the MitoPilot GitHub repository. You could use custom databases by providing the full path to the appropriate FASTA files on your local computer or cluster.\nLikewise, you could provide a custom .gb reference database for MitoFinder. The default option is the Danio rerio reference mitogenome (GenBank NC_002333.2).\nSee our documentation for more info about custom GetOrganalle or MitoFinder databases,\nFor the test project, we’ll stick with GetOrganalle and the default settings.",

Some samples may finish faster than others.\n\n\n\nFig. 15\n\n\nYou may notice that some samples fail at certain steps (though this is unlikely for the test dataset).

You may wish to modify the job name (-N) and the log file name (-o).\n#!/bin/sh\n#$ -N MitoPilot_assembly # MODIFY THIS IF DESIRED\n#$ -o MitoPilot_assembly.log # MODIFY THIS IF DESIRED\n#$ -cwd -j y\n#$ -q lTWFM.sq\n#$ -l wfmq\n#$ -pe mthread 2\n#$ -S /bin/sh\n\necho + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME\n\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nmodule load tools/java/21.0.2 # required for Nextflow on Hydra\n\n# EXAMPLE NEXTFLOW COMMAND\nnextflow -log /pool/public/genomics/macguigand/MitoPilot/NMNH_workshop_2025/test_project_01/.logs/nextflow.log run /home/macguigand/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/4.4/MitoPilot/nextflow -c /pool/public/genomics/macguigand/MitoPilot/NMNH_workshop_2025/test_project_01/.config -entry WF1 \n\necho = `date` job $JOB_NAME done\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must use the options -q lTWFM.sq and -l wfmq. This is a special Hydra queue for workflow managers like Nextflow. You must also include -pe mthread 2 in order to have enough available RAM for building the MitoPilot Singularity image.\n\n\nMove the submission script into your MitoPilot project directory. In the above example, /pool/public/genomics/macguigand/MitoPilot/22030FL-06-02/run_02/. Then submit the job using qsub MY_SCRIPT_NAME.sh.\nYou can monitor the progress of this job using the qstat command and by checking on the log files. Once the job is done, you can relaunch the GUI to inspect the results. The same approach can be used for the Annotate module.",
