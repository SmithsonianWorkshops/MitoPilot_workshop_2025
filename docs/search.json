But for now, you will need to install your own copy of Nextflow on the cluster. Login to Hydra and run the following.\n# Nextflow installation instructions\n# from https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html\ncd ~\n# load Java module, needed by Nextflow\nmodule load tools/java/21.0.2\n# install Nextflow\ncurl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash \n# make Nextflow executable\nchmod +x nextflow \nThere will now be an executable nextflow file in your home directory. You should move it to a location that is in your PATH. For example:\n # create bin directory, if needed\nmkdir ~/bin\n# move nextflow to bin directory\nmv ~/nextflow ~/bin/nextflow \n# add bin directory to PATH, in case it's not already there\necho 'export PATH=\"${HOME}/bin:${PATH}\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc \n# reload your bash configuration file\nsource ~/.bashrc\nThis should allow you to call nextflow from anywhere on the cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must load the Hydra Java module (module load tools/java/21.0.2) whenever you wish to use Nextflow.",
