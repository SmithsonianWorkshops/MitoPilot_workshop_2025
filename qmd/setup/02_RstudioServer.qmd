## Launching RStudio server

We will use RStudio server to run MitoPilot. RStudio server on Hydra functions just like the normal RStudio on your local computer, except that you are accessing it remotely.

To launch RStudio server on Hydra:

- login to Hydra
- run `conda deactivate` to avoid package conflicts (may not be necessary for all users)
- run `module load tools/R/RStudio/server`
- run `start-rstudio-server` (you may be asked to run a different command if this is your first time)
- leave this cluster terminal window open 
- in a new terminal window on your local computer:
	- start an ssh tunnel by running something like `ssh -N -L 8787:compute-64-16:8787 sylvain@hydra-login01.si.edu`
	  - the exact command should have been printed by `start-rstudio-server` in your cluster terminal window
	- leave this local terminal window open
	- open a web browser and enter `http://localhost:8787` in the URL bar
	- enter your cluster login credentials to access the RStudio server
	- any commands run in this new window will execute on the cluster in the interactive session
