## First-time installation

To install MitoPilot, use the RStudio server window to run the following. This might take a while.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("Smithsonian/MitoPilot")
```

You may see a warning like this:

```
Installation paths not writeable, unable to update packages
  path: /share/apps/bioinformatics/R/4.4.1/lib64/R/library
```

This is not a problem. Some R packages are installed at the Hydra system level and cannot be updated by the user.

If there were no other error messages, you're ready to start using MitoPilot!

## Updating MitoPilot

If you need to update MitoPilot, run the following commands in RStudio server.

```r
remove.packages("MitoPilot")
BiocManager::install("Smithsonian/MitoPilot")
.rs.restartR()
```

This will remove the old package, install the most recent version, and restart your R session. After updating, you will need to reload the package with `library(MitoPilot)`.

We also recommend clearing your Singularity cache with `singularity cache clean` whenever you update MitoPilot. This will ensure you are using the latest MitoPilot Singularity image.
